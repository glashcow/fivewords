query the thing like this, if you want a word that ends "erd", then ask

..erd


or say you only know letter 2 and 4, then you'd

.a.e.




if you want the word to include letters but you don't know where they are then 

a.a.e dg 

would match adage, note no spaces between the letters you want, but if you...

cl.ck op

you'll match nothing as there's no p in clock.




if you know you DON'T want specific letters, then do this

a.a.e w | r

this would match awake but not aware, as after the "|" indicates the letters you don't want.
